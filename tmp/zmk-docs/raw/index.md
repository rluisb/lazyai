# Introduction to ZMK | ZMK Firmware

Source: https://zmk.dev/docs

---

ZMK Firmware is an open source (MIT) keyboard firmware built on the [Zephyr™ Project](https://zephyrproject.org/) Real Time Operating System (RTOS). ZMK's goal is to provide a modern and powerful firmware that is designed for power-efficiency, flexibility, and broad hardware support. ZMK is capable of being used for both wired and wireless input devices.
